Why do we needs threads?
OpenRAN:

- 32 Cores: 100GB 
-->             --->
-->     Server  --->
-->             --->
-->             --->

run.exe (1 core)

Sol: running on multiple threads

Job1, job2, job3, job20


Process -> Threads

uses:
1) CPUs utilization
2) Concurrency (Parallel execution)

job1->job2->job3->  .... 1000

Thread1, Thread2, Thread3





Process1 , Process2: IPC (pipes, MsgQ, Shared mem, Sockets)
